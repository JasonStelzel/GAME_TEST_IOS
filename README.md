# GAME_TEST_IOS

A component based app which uses a modular approach to creating a simple game app to facilitate experiments with creating frameworks for tests, engines, routing as well as UI, modeling and main construction of the app.  The goal is to create a componentized app that can easily support multiple Apple architectures with the same game, test and routing engines by substituting a different UI to run the same engines with the Apple Watch, AppleTV, Mac and iOS devices.
